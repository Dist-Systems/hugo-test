# Seclab Website

This project utilizes the Hugo framework to generate a static website. 

The artifacts are generated by scripts in the `tools` directory via the commands invoked from the **Makefile**.

There is an accompanying Dockerfile in the registry that accompanys this repo (https://git.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/seclab/website/container_registry).

## Getting started

There are 2 main ways to get started with this project:

- clone the repo if you would like to make changes:
  - `git clone git@git.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu:seclab/website.git`
- Docker option (just take a look at the website served locally):
  - `docker pull git.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu:4567/seclab/website`
  - `docker run -it --rm -p 1313:1313 seclab/website`
