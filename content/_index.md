# About

The International Secure Systems Lab (iSecLab) is a "meta-lab," composed of a number of security research labs with deep personal and professional connections. iSecLab members collaborate closely, apply for joint funding, share data, exchange ideas, and have fun together. iSecLab encourages and supports student and faculty mobility within the labs. The research focus is on applied computer security, with a recent emphasis on web security, malware analysis, cybercrime, and vulnerability analysis.

The iSecLab was originally founded in 2005 at the [Technical University of Vienna](https://www.tuwien.ac.at).
In its first years of existence, the iSecLab grew to include the [Institute Eurécom](https://www.eurecom.fr) in the French Riviera and the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://cs.ucsb.edu).
In 2010, [Ruhr University in Bochum](https://www.emma.rub.de) (Germany) joined the iSecLab family, and, in 2011, [Northeastern University](https://seclab.ccs.neu.edu/) came on board.
In the following years, as student members became professors with their own labs, the iSecLab has kept growing, and labs from [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) (UK), [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/) (USA), [Boston University](https://www.bu.com/) (USA), [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) (Italy), [NC State University](https://ncsu.edu) (USA), [The University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu) (USA), [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu) (USA), and [Princeton University](https://princeton.edu) (USA) joined the iSecLab.

With the move of faculty members to other universities and pursuit of other ventures, the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it), and [The University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu) have since departed the iSecLab.
